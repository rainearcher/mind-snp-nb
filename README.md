# Linking the Genetic Variants and Altered Protein PTM Landscape in Cardiovascular Diseases via Artificial Intelligence

The growing number of cardiovascular Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) serves as a strong foundation to study the role of variants in cardiovascular diseases. To investigate whether post-translational modifications (PTM) of proteins impact the mechanistic insight underlying the pathogenesis introduced by genetic variants, we explored the link between genetic variants, their mutant products, and their PTMs landscape. In this study, we examined 5,712 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) from cardiovascular-relevant GWAS, using information extracted from GWAS Catalog (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/). We constructed a new application using the Artificial Intelligence (AI) model, [MIND AI model](https://github.com/yuyanislearning/MIND), to define and analyze the altered landscape of 13 frequently occurred PTMs affected by SNPs. Among the cardiovascular SNPs studied, 10 genetic variants were found to alter PTM occurrence with high confidence; 6 SNPs displayed disrupted PTMs, whereas in 4 SNPs, PTMs were promoted. Further analyses revealed that several disrupted PTMs are involved in distinct biological processes, indicating PTMs play important roles linking variants and diseases. Notably, PTMs promoted by genetic variants have not been previously documented, suggesting new targets and functions of PTMs. Taken together, understanding the altered landscape of PTM offers a novel layer of mechanistic insight underlying the pathogenesis introduced by genetic variants.
